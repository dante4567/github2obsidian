# github2obsidian
extract basic info from my starred github repos (readme, number of stars, and - most importantly - topics/tags), create markdown for use in obsidian, the github topics/tags are included in obsidian tag-syntax, allowing to facility tag- and link-tools of obsidian (graph-view, tag-extensions....)
